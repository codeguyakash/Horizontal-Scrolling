# Frontend Software Engineer Intern - Beginner-Friendly Creative Challenge

### Assignment Overview:
Welcome to the creative phase of the Uibix Frontend Software Engineer Intern assessment! This assignment is designed for those with limited development experience. It aims to explore your creativity and basic frontend skills in an enjoyable way. Let's build an engaging website together!

### Task: Horizontal Storytelling Webpage with ReactJS

#### Objective:
Create a storytelling webpage that scrolls horizontally between three pages using the mouse wheel. Make it visually appealing and add a fun drawing feature as a bonus, all while utilizing ReactJS.

#### Sample Design:
You can refer to [this figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/CpeoPkSBVNbMQwism5bL3Y/Uibix-Assignment?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=94sX9sOptIsr7sEm-1) if you want some idea about page content, or you can also follow the design as it is.

#### Instructions:

1. Setting Up the React App:
   - Create a new React app using `create-react-app` or your preferred method.
   - Structure your app with three components, each representing a different part of your story; refer to design above.
   - You can add dummy content to each page or use your creative brain to make some bold headlines or content.

2. Horizontal Scrolling Setup:
   - In the CSS for your React components, set up horizontal scrolling using the `overflow-x` property. This ensures your pages scroll horizontally.
   - Utilize React's state and event handling to control the horizontal scrolling triggered by the mouse wheel.
   - Ensure each section (React component) takes up the full width of the viewport.

3. Adding Transitions:
   - Experiment with simple CSS transitions for page changes. Use React state to manage transitions between pages.
   - Alternatively, you can use the [animate.css](https://animate.style/) or any other animation library for easy animations within your React components. Include the library in your project and apply classes for animation effects.

4. Interactive Drawing:
   - Make the complete webpage a drawing area using the HTML5 `<canvas>` element within a React component. Take hint from this [codepen snippet](https://codepen.io/julio_ok/pen/ozpqGO)
   - Write JavaScript (or JSX) code within your React components to capture mouse movements on the canvas, allowing users to draw with mouse anywhere on the screen.
   - Utilize React state to manage the drawing and implement a timer or `setTimeout` to automatically clear the drawings after 3 seconds when the user moves the mouse away.

5. Bonus (for the adventurous):
   - Explore additional React libraries for animations or transitions to enhance your storytelling.
   - Experiment with incorporating third-party React components for unique effects.
   - Make the webpages responses as shown in design above.

#### Outcome Expected:
A visually appealing storytelling webpage built with ReactJS that scrolls horizontally between three pages using the mouse wheel. Users should be able to draw on the page as a bonus feature.

### Submission Instructions:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub specifically for this assignment.
